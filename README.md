### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My current personal projects (pinned below) are about cloud services :see GCP & AWS worflows projects. I am also keen on Kubernetes, that I consider as the strategic IT architecture to gain agility and reduce time-to-market in order to better compete in a software-driven world: see Knative and Microservices on K8s.
